/*Create a class called "RestrictedData". The class has two data members: publicData (this data member can be accessed from anywhere), and privateData (this data member can only be accessed within the class). Implement a constructor that initializes both publicData and privateData to 0. Implement a member function setData() which will be used to take input from the user to set values for both publicData and privateData.*/
